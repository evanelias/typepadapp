`typepadapp.views.base` provides a basis for building Django views that use
TypePad API resources.

As TypePad API resources are best requested in a single batch request, the
class-based view implementation in `TypePadView` affords grouping all required
data at once in the `select_from_typepad()` method, which can be retrieved in
a batch and provided to your view's implementation.

class TypePadView(GenericView):

    A subclass of the ``GenericView`` class that adds TypePad-specific

    This class supports several members that make it easy to handle
    forms and pagination.

    In particular, a special method ``select_from_typepad()`` may be declared
    for a subclass of ``TypePadView``. When this method is present, a
    batch request is made to the TypePad API for all data elements requested
    in the ``select_from_typepad()`` method.

    .. rubric:: Class attributes:

    * ``paginate_by``: specify this value if the view is to support pagination
      of a list of objects. An ``object_list`` member is expected to be
      assigned in order to provide context for pagination. A template context
      variable named ``page_obj`` is also set, being an instance of
      ``FinitePaginator``.
    * ``object_list``: Assign to this member when the view is to paginate a
      list of objects.
    * ``offset``: When paginating a list of objects, this member is
      automatically assigned, based on the ``page`` parameter to the view and
      the value of the ``paginate_by`` property. This value may be used to
      control the selection of rows used to populate the ``object_list``
      member during the `setup()` or `select_from_typepad()` methods.
    * ``limit``: Assigned as the number of rows to select for the
      ``object_list`` member. This is typically set to ``paginate_by``.
    * ``paginate_template``: Assign a string to control the format of next,
      previous links.
    * ``form``: The Django form class that is to be used for any editable
      object the view is presenting. If this member is set, it is instantiated
      during the `setup()` method and during a ``POST`` request, the values of
      the ``POST`` are given to it. Once the form is instantiated, it is
      assigned to a ``form_instance`` instance attribute. The form is also
      assigned to the template context as ``form``.
    * ``template_name``: Assign the name of a Django template file to be used
      for ``GET`` requests. The value of this property is stripped of any path
      and suffix and assigned to the ``view`` template context variable.
    * ``login_required``: If the view requires an authenticated user to run,
      set this member to True. It relies on the settings.LOGIN_URL value for
      redirecting the user to a login form.

    .. rubric:: Template variables:

    These variables are available for any `TypePadView`.

    * ``view``: The basename of the ``template_name`` member, minus any file
      path and extension.
    * ``form``: The Django `Form` instance for this view, if this kind of view
      has a form.
    * ``page_obj``: The Django `Paginator` instance for this view, if the view
      is paged.
